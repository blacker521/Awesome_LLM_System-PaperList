Here's a quote I really like: if a person doesn't read books, then his values will be determined by those around him, because he has no other input but to mimic those around him and follow whatever is popular around him, never finding himself.

Some reading material can give us great experiences and philosophical reflections, and some particular useful materials, here are some of the materials I've read and will be reading next.&#x20;
